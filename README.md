# Currency-Exchange-Rate-Calculator

## Synopsis
This is my first React project. I made it 2 years ago (2019-2020). The interface looks ugly and the code is a pile of BS, but it has memorable value.

It's so poor that I chose to wipe it from my brain back then. But now I'm happy to (re)discover this while organizing my account. Time flies :D
